# SnowControl

Makes snow more "real" and configurable, by allowing it to fall "through" leaves (and any other object you want), in addition to allowing snow to accumulate and melt.

Also, when breaking a block with snow on it, the snow will "fall" (similar to sand or gravel) and pile up on any snow that's underneath.

Snow will only accumulate while it's snowing, and can pile up as much as you want.

Snow will also melt (configurable) during the day if it's not snowing. It can melt down to one layer (default), or down to nothing.

#### WARNING 
This plugin is very CPU intensive, and if you have a very large server with many players always on, this plugin may cause lag.
Also, if your server hardware is old and out dated it may also have issues running this plugin.
Having said this, my real server where this is running is a Dual core Xeon @ 3.00GHz with 4GB ram, and haven't had any issues.

### Installation
Download jar and place it in your plugins folder. (http://wiki.bukkit.org/Installing_Plugins)

### Configuration Defaults
"SnowFall.CheckEvery" is how often each snow eligible block will be checked. It is not recommended to set less than 5 seconds, or if you have a large server with many players, the higher the better.
And then every time a block is checked, there is a chance it can accumulate, or melt based on the config below.

#### Wish I had time to Do List
* Make thrown snowballs create snow patches.
* Make thrown snowballs cause damage.
* Make thrown snowballs cause slowdown (freezing effect).
* Make deeper snow slow down players and/or mobs.
* Create custom snow related recipes (ideas welcome)
* Enable for snow on mountains not in a snowy biome
